Who knows how many test suites were not created because of a classic parry.

> It cannot be tested — it uses a platform call!

Well, it is not actually true all the time.
Unit testing something that only a human eye and neural networks
can catch — like animations — doesn’t make sense.
On the other hand, retrying a network request on a re-established connection
can and should be tested. As a bonus, it is possible to gain a couple of perks.

# Theory

The main advice I can give Android developers about testing —
start thinking about the codebase as a platform-agnostic environment.
Not in a ridiculous way but in a more pragmatic one — otherwise, it is too
easy to slip on a dark cross-platform path. Associating the codebase
with the JVM platform and not specifically Android is a better idea.
Framework-related interactions can be plugged-in as composable blocks.

Another advice — embrace abstractions available on hand.
Samples in this article are based on RxJava but it is possible to replace it
with `Future`, `Promise` or Kotlin coroutines.
This is especially useful with `async` + `await` type of interactions.
Believe me, it is not wise to do everything from scratch if there is a good tech
available. Moreover, it is easier to maintain consistency
in the codebase if each component speaks using the same constructs.
Do not repeat the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel) fall.

# Practice

Lke it or not — platform interactions leak into the business logic.
It is understandable — the environment capabilities should be embraced.

At the same time, it is essential to test the logic of the final product —
otherwise, there will be no product at all, only issues and undefined behavior.

Fortunately enough, the mankind have dealt with such issues for a while.
Let’s use a weight measurement example. How much does a brick weight?
Well, certainly less than a space station and more than an atom.
That characteristic does not really help when it is necessary to transport
a number of bricks. Will a car break under a million bricks?
That’s why humanity created _abstractions_, such as grams, kilograms and tons.
It is possible to take this completely (but collectively) made up measurement unit
and apply it everywhere. Well, except
[three countries](http://mentalfloss.com/article/55895/countries-havent-adopted-metric-system)
that do not use [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system).

Software development provides means to create abstractions easy-as.
It is not necessary to create
an [ISO](https://www.iso.org/) committee to create one — a programming language is enough.
Android is not an exception — and it never was.

## Connectivity

It can be useful to retry stalled network requests when OS reconnects
to a network access point. In fact,
[`ConnectivityManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager)
was there for centuries:

> The primary responsibilities of this class are to:
> monitor network connections (Wi-Fi, GPRS, UMTS, etc)...

The usage of the potential abstraction looks like this.

```kotlin
disposable += connectivity.available.subscribe(refresh)
```

Seems like a single stream will be enough. Let’s do it!

```kotlin
interface Connectivity {

    val available: Observable<Unit>

    class AndroidConnectivity(context: AndroidContext) : Connectivity {

        private val manager = context.systemService<ConnectivityManager>()

        override val available = Observable.merge(current, updates)

        private val current = Observable
            .fromCallable { manager.isDefaultNetworkActive() }
            .filter { it == true }
            .map { Unit }

        private val updates = Observable.create<Unit> { emitter ->
            val listener = OnNetworkActiveListener { emitter.onNext(Unit) }

            manager.addDefaultNetworkActiveListener(listener)
            emitter.setCancellable { manager.removeDefaultNetworkActiveListener(listener) }
        }
    }
}
```

Marvelous! A couple of things to notice here.

The `Observable` itself handles proper `Listener` setting on subscription and
unsetting on unsubscription. It uses the
[Dispose pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispose_pattern),
i. e. the RxJava `Disposable`. Since all `Observable` behave the same
the end-user of the `Connectivity` will work with it as with any other
`Observable`.

Since there is an `interface` it is easy to provide a `Test*` implementation
for unit tests. Just a single call to simulate the real-world behavior and that’s it —
it is possible to test code which works with the platform framework.

```kotlin
class TestConnectivity : Connectivity {
    override val available = PublishSubject.create<Unit>()
}
```

```kotlin
context("connectivity becomes available") {

    beforeEach {
        connectivity.available.onNext(Unit)
    }

    it("refreshes") {
        verify(refresh).run()
    }
}
```

## Launching

What about starting something via `Intent`? The operation itself is trivial,
but it is necessary to keep in mind that there might be an `ActivityNotFoundException`.
This exception is being thrown when nobody can handle our intention.

```kotlin
disposable += launcher.launch(Request.ShareText("Ping!"))
    .observeOn(mainThread)
    .subscribe {
        when (result) {
            Result.Success -> view.showSuccessAlert()
            Result.Failure -> view.showFailureAlert()
        }
    }
```

To achieve this we are going to create our own abstraction over `Intent`.
Doing so will hide the complexity and will help to avoid a copy-paste
of the same `Intent` building over and over again.

```kotlin
interface Launcher {

    sealed class Request {
        data class ShareText(val text: String) : Request()
    }

    enum class Result { Success, Failure }

    fun launch(request: Request): Single<Result>

    class AndroidLauncher(
            private val application: Application,
            private val mainScheduler: Scheduler
    ) : Launcher {

        override fun launch(request: Request) = application.currentActivity
                .take(1)
                .singleOrError()
                .map { activity ->
                    try {
                        activity.startActivity(createIntent(request))
                        Result.Success
                    } catch (e: ActivityNotFoundException) {
                        Result.Failure
                    }
                }
                .subscribeOn(mainScheduler)

        private inline fun createIntent(request: Request) = when (request) {
            is Request.ShareText -> {
                val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND).apply {
                    flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
                    type = "text/plain"
                    putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, request.text)
                }

                Intent.createChooser(intent, /* chooser title */ null)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We are controlling the thread under the hood so the consumer does not need to know
implementation details.

An attentive reader might notice that we are using
another abstraction — `Application#currentActivity`. It is trivial to implement using
[`ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks) and
`Connectivity`-like approach to listeners and callbacks.

Of course, we can test the behavior.

```kotlin
class TestLauncher: Launcher {
    val result = SingleSubject.create<Result>()

    override fun launch(request: Request) = result
}
```

```kotlin
context("launch result is success") {

    beforeEach {
        launcher.result.onSuccess(Result.Success)
    }

    it("shows success alert") {
        verify(view).showSuccessAlert()
    }
}

context("launch result is failure") {

    beforeEach {
        launcher.result.onSuccess(Result.Failure)
    }

    it("shows failure alert") {
        verify(view).showFailureAlert()
    }
}
```

## Google Play Services

The concept works well not only with the platform
but with all third-party information sources — such as various SDK.
In such cases, it is possible to improve the external API — for example,
provide proper nullability handling if the SDK is not annotated with `@Nullable` and `@NonNull`.

Let’s say it is necessary to show a warning if Google Play Services
is not installed.

```kotlin
disposable += googlePlayServices.available
    .filter { it == false }
    .observeOn(mainThread)
    .subscribe(view::showGooglePlayServicesWarningAlert)
```

Implementation:

```kotlin
interface GooglePlayServices {

    val available: Single<Boolean>

    class PackagedGooglePlayServices(
        context: AndroidContext,
        ioScheduler: Scheduler
    ) : GooglePlayServices {

        override val available = Single
            .fromCallable { GoogleApiAvailability.getInstance().isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(context) }
            .map { it == ConnectionResult.SUCCESS }
            .subscribeOn(ioScheduler)
    }
}
```

The work is done on IO thread since retrieving the information can take an undefined amount of time.

As always, it is possible to test the behavior without mocking static
`GoogleApiAvailability` `getInstance()` method.

```kotlin
class TestGooglePlayServices : GooglePlayServices {
    override val available = SingleSubject.create<Boolean>()
}
```

```kotlin
context("Google Play Services is available") {

    beforeEach {
        googlePlayServices.available.onSuccess(true)
    }

    it("does not show warning alert") {
        verifyNever(view).showGooglePlayServicesWarningAlert()
    }
}

context("Google Play Services is not available") {

    beforeEach {
        googlePlayServices.available.onSuccess(false)
    }

    it("shows warning alert") {
        verify(view).showGooglePlayServicesWarningAlert()
    }
}
```

# Retrospective

The beautiful thing about abstractions is that the idea is universal and can be applied everywhere:

* Runtime permissions.
* Requesting data via `startActivityForResult`.
* Notifications and push messages processing.
* Location updates, accessibility, battery and Bluetooth checks...

At the same time, using a high-level abstraction — like the reactive approach
(RxJava in particular) — brings a couple of benefits.

* Proper multi-threading maintained by producers.
* Ease of testing via producer-consumer components such as `Subject`.

The ironic thing about abstractions is that developers create them all the time
for their own domain. But... tend to avoid it for external sources.
Do not make this mistake.
