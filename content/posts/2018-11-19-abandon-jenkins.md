CI and CD techniques are a part of all good happenned to the software development.
Having CI (at least) in place means better productivity and higher confidence
in the result of the everyday work. Sounds kinda obvious, right?
Well, let’s take a look at the dark side of the moon.

Do you have a person on the team who occasionally curses Gradle or (and) Maven,
Android SDK or (and) NDK? Maybe someone who knows everything about
these weird Shell scripts you have in the repository? You know, the one
who doesn’t like mentions about broken nightly builds, looks at the `htop`
from time to time, tries to throw something out of a window when
someone mentions Jenkins? Yeah, _the tooling person_. The fancy name nowadays
is a _Developer Experience Engineer_. Right. The question is — do you want to be
this person? No worries — I already know the answer.

# Nah
